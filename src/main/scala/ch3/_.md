- Techniques
    + 尺取法
        * propogate two parts in turn
        * right bound +1, try reduce left bound
        * e.g. Subsequence, JessicaReading
    + Inverse Program
        * face the right way
        * lights out
    + Physical Collison
    + Enumerate from both side
        * Four Sum Zero
        * Both large backpack
    + Discretize coordinate system
        
- Int Representation of Combination Sets
    + Subset of (0,1, ... n-1) can be encoded as Sum(2^i)
    + Iterate through subsets
        * `for (s<-0 until 1<<n)`
    + Special Sets
        * Empty = `0`
        * with i-th element = `1<<i`
        * with first n elments = `(1<<n)-1`
    + If has elements i
        * `if (S>>i&1)`
    + Add/Remove elements
        * union = `S|U`
        * intersection = `S&U`
        * add i-th = `S|1<<i`
        * remove i-th = `S&~(1<<i)`
